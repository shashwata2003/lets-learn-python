"""Pair with same divisors
An integer n is said to be the divisor of another integer m if m leaves a remainder 0 when divided by n. We define a function : d(N) which is the number of pairs  (a,b) such that, a<b,  a*b=N and both the integers a and b have the same number of divisors.     For 24, we can have the pairs : (2,12), (3,8),(4,6), (1,24),(8,3).  Here in any of the pair, the number of divisors of both the integers in a pair is not the  same. Hence, d(24)=0. For 48, the pairs are : (3,16),(2,24),  (4,12) , (1,48)and (6,8). Here the pair (6,8) is a pair such that both 6 and 8 have 4 divisors.  That is, (6,8) is a pair in which both the integers have same number of divisors. Other pairs of 48, do not have this property. Hence d(48)=1.

Given a positive integer N, Write a code to compute the value of d(N).  For a given number N, if no pairs  (a,b) such that a<b, a*b=N, are possible, your code should output -1
Input format:

Enter the number N
